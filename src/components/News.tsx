<h5>Another year is here, which means it’s time to set some goals and for booklovers, this can sometimes include tackling their TBR,<br /> reading more broadly, or simply trying to pick up a book more often.</h5>



    <h5>Well, our 2022 Reading Challenge is here to help! Consisting of 52 challenges, you could potentially read a book a week <br/>
        or use this as a guide so when it comes to selecting your next book, you’re not going back and forth or<br/> even to those books you’ve read already. br
        There’s no rules so do whichever challenge or whatever order you’d like!</h5>

<h5>The college campus has been a popular setting for books since the days of ancient Greece. <br/> In fact, Aristotle once wrote a dark academic thriller—Bald-Faced Lyres—set at his lyceum circa 300 BCE.
 </h5>
  <h5>We kid, we kid. But it’s true that the campus novel is an interesting specimen that can cut across multiple genres. Here we’ve collected a class of relatively  new books where most or all of the action takes place in a high school or college campus setting, brjust in time for back-to-school reading/procrastination! You'll also notice we've appended a footnote section at the bottom for Notable Alumni—three additional <br /> famous books with campus themes that we couldn't bear leaving off this list.</h5>
